This application is under development, I had already created this application before, but it can be refactored!!

What is Motus-Finance Management? Motus is a way for you to organize your finances without much effort and with a lot of practicality. Here you will have:

- Possibility of adding as many colors as you want to represent the bank.
- Add your salary and the app will calculate your expenses and income in real time.
- Choose the bank's due date, limit and name.
- You choose the icon that will appear in your bank.
- Add expenses and income in the way you want, being able to choose whether they are fixed or variable and their classification.
- Automatic update when the due date arrives, thus excluding variable expenses/income, without you having to do it manually and updating the due date for the next month.
- Customized graphs with the percentage of each classification, showing how much you spent that month with each classification.
- Graph showing how much you spent in the last 5 months.
- A list with the classifications and the respective expenses in each classification.
- Change of language and currency.

Motus is the financial management application you always wanted, fully customized and complete to improve your experience.

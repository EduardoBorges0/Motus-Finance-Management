This application is under development, I had already created this application before, but it can be refactored!!

What is Motus Market? Motus is a way for you to organize your shoppings without much effort and with a lot of practicality. Here you will have:

- Add, delete and edit stores you want to buy from.
- Add, delete or edit purchases according to the market.
- Classify purchases according to what you want, such as hygiene, cleaning, etc.
- Detailed graphs of the value of purchases from previous months and the current month.
- Each graph will have the classification of what you spent the most on each month.
